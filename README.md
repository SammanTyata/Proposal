****Summary of Project****

Every traveler, whether a seasoned explorer or casual tourist, often faces the challenge of
finding authentic local experiences and avoiding overcrowded tourist spots. This can result
in missing out on hidden gems, lesser-known attractions, and unique local events or
festivals cherished by locals.

NextQuest addresses this by offering personalized recommendations to help users
uncover unique destinations and cultural happenings near them. Whether it's a corner
café, an undiscovered scenic viewpoint, or a local festival, NextQuest ensures that users
can explore with confidence and discover places that reflect the true essence of their
location.

This app aims to inspire travelers to step off the beaten path, embrace local culture,
and make their journey more meaningful, memorable, and connected to the authentic
experiences and events of the place they are visiting.

****Project Analysis****

**Value Proposition:**

NextQuest effectively addresses the following challenges faced by travelers:

1. Discovering Authentic Experiences - Many travelers struggle to find genuine, local
experiences, often ending up at overcrowded tourist hotspots that fail to capture the
the true essence of their destinations.

2. Over-Reliance on Mainstream Travel Apps - Research indicates that 60% of travelers
prefer oE-the-beaten-path experiences (Skift, 2021), yet many rely on mainstream
travel applications that often direct them to congested areas, limiting their exposure to
unique attractions.

3. Lack of Access to Local Culture - Travelers frequently overlook unique local festivals
and cultural events that can significantly enhance their journey, as they lack reliable
and accessible information about these hidden gems.

**Primary Purpose:**

The primary purpose of NextQuest is to connect travelers with authentic, lesser-known
attractions and local experiences. By providing personalized recommendations based on
real-time location, the app helps users discover hidden gems and unique cultural events.

tourist spots, redefining travel through meaningful connections and unforgettable
experiences.

**Challenges and Open Questions******

**Challenges:**

1. Offline mode: Users may have limited or no internet access while exploring, which can hinder app functionality.
   
Solution: Develop an online mode that allows users to download specific regions for online access.

2. External Storage Dependencies: Relying on third-party APIs (like Google Maps) can introduce vulnerabilities if these services experience downtime or changes in their terms of service.

Solution: Design the app to have fallback mechanisms, such as caching important data locally or using alternative mapping services if a primary API is unavailable

3. Data Accuracy: User-generated content may include inappropriate or irrelevant information, impacting the app's credibility.
   
Solution: Implement a flagging/review system to maintain content quality.

**Open questions:**

1. How to best incentivize users to contribute and engage without overwhelming them?
   
2. What’s the most efficient way to verify the authenticity of lesser-known spots?
